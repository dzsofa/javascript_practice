        <h2>Hold on to your butts</h2>
        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
          men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
          darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
          thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
          you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

          <h2>I gotta piss</h2>
          <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
            how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times
            they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the
            kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

            Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to
            me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>
